	'create an app for different athena versions

	messages in dialogs need to open in center of that dialog not UI

	color all scrolls like in database dialog

	look for instances of IsNothing, IsNot Nothing, Utility.IsNothing within my Code

	can add table types to database dialog under "New"

	add speech recognition

	Update NodeEditor and ScriptEditor with Threads 

	Make sure all useless buttons are unenabled in DatabaseEditor
	Can I make a remove database/table/column list instead of having a remove in each cell
	or maybe a check-for-duplicates in the remove fuctions

	
	Thoughts:
	1. in the specialized detect table (within the limiter columns) you can have numberical compare and multiple choices of entries

	2. hints or actual declaration of choices

	what about procedual generation
	
	scope - the most common and most interesting things people would try
	most commonly they would just kill the player if an option is not chosen.

	create a 3D engine for a text world, so that interaction of text would have rules, 
	and so interaction doesn't have to be expressed/handwritten for every event but generated by a set of environmental rules 


	we might need to turn on or off the debug tracker within the Store/Count function in the Tables Class. Right now it is not logging it because it would leave
	too many entries
	
	I think we need to set which database the NLP will use in the story header, to make sure the correct info is being used for the particular story.  




	I need to figure how to make Windows 10 register Athena so it will open without being suspected.
	
	
	when the last thing is said will that be the end of that story or will one more thing needs to be said,
	I think the 'end' tag end automatically while leaving it alone will end it on the second. 
	need to purposefully end every story end with the tag 'end'

	when you make a query story, since it is locked in choices, need to remember to exit if not interested in answering the question, 
	and maybe you could ask to not here something again and have it not brought up,
	I know there needs to be a block command added to block anything through the filter or block table? 

	does the UI exit the brain code correctly in order to save the data to the file. 

	save story info to tags, like story nam, page name, all finished storyies need to be saved too



	'OVERALL CONTENT
	make avatars
	make stories

Avatar: should random animations start at a specified frame (by random chance) 

Database: if a column is modified then only that column is replaced

Remember to add 'try catches' to main and matrix, setup and integrity checks

Save story states using addresses?

Ummm... you need to cause the node editor's-Xml editor's window to display the line count

it would be nice if the mouse wheel worked too.

hey, what about using the search feature in the tags within Node editor :D
(or perhaps the search feature will be in the XML editor)


Athena launcher that maybe checks integrity, allows for Athena update from Github, maybe allows for sign-in for security, gets multiple versions of Athena,
allow for options like: window size, profile, package, etc.

Code assistant - shows all matrix fuctions, examples, commands, how-tos

Update website.
